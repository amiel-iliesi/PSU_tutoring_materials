# Bigger Example

Just to give you something slightly more substantial than the other tiny code
snippets from before, here's a sample program written in `C++` and `Python` that
generates a list of primes up to a given number, and outputs them.

There's nothing much in terms of explaining here. This little chapter/program is
just here to give you a bit more of a feel of what `Python` code looks like vs.
`C++` code.

As a _minor note_, notice that we don't have to do any memory management at all
in `Python`. That is one benefit to writing in `Python`.
