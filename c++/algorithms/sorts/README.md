# Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are procedures that take an unsorted container of elements,
and modifies that container so the elements are in order (in this case,
ascending order).

## File Structure

* `makefile`: supplied for you.
* `main.cpp`: runs the sorting algorithms.
* `<SORT>.cpp/h`: the files that contain the implementation of the sort.

## Main

All main does is:
1. Create an array of unique and shuffled elements
2. Go through all the supplied sorting algorithms and runs them
3. Confirms whether or not the array is sorted.

These sections should be clearly identified by section comment headers.
