# Insertion

## Easy
* Insert a 5 into the tree.

## Medium
* Given an array of numbers, insert them into the tree.

## Hard
* Given two trees, insert one into the other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Traversal

## Easy
* Determine if there is a 5 in the tree.
* Return the minumum of the tree.
* Return the maximum of the tree.

## Medium
* Count the number of elements in the tree.
* Sum up the tree.
* Sum up the elements at depth of 2.
* Display the tree, in reverse order.
* Display all leaves.
* Make a copy of the tree.

## Hard
* Sum up all the elements at height of 2. Remember: height and depth are
  essentially opposites.
* Return the IOS of the root's right child, if it exists. Return -1 otherwise.
* Invert the tree.
* Make a copy of the tree, filtered by evens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Removal

## Easy
* Remove the minimum of the tree.
* Remove the maxiumum of the tree.

## Medium
* Remove the root.

## Hard
* Remove all evens.
* Remove all elements that have a neighboring element in-order, in the
  tree, which is 1 greater than themselves. EG: if the tree has {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
  then you would remove 3 and 4 from the tree.
